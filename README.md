# Tokey

Tokey is a configurable general-purpose code tokenizer that supports comment and string skipping. When you need to find specific structure in a code block such as imports in JavaScript, or URLs in CSS, and you don't want to use a full-blown Parser you can create a specific tokenizer to do the job.
